## Course Description:
As your programs or web applications become more complex, you'll want to test them to make sure that new changes don't break their original functionality. With everything we do online, there's a vast amount of sensitive information at risk: email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, and much more.

In the [(Legacy) Information Security and Quality Assurance Certification][course-link], you'll learn how to write tests with Chai to ensure your applications work the way you expect them to, and build a secure web app with HelmetJS to learn the fundamentals of protecting people's information online.
