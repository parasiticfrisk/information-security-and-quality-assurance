## Course Description:
As your programs or web applications become more complex, you'll want to test them to make sure that new changes don't break their original functionality. With everything we do online, there's a vast amount of sensitive information at risk: email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, and much more.

In the Information Security and Quality Assurance Certification, you'll learn how to write tests with Chai to ensure your applications work the way you expect them to, and build a secure web app with HelmetJS to learn the fundamentals of protecting people's information online.
